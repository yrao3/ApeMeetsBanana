# ApeMeetsBanana

We all know the famous CoffeMeetsBagel dating apps. Here comes an idea of matching dapp for Bored Apes in Web3. Instead of matching for some kind of boring relationships, we are here to match for paird staking in the coming ApeCoin + BAYC NFT farming season! 

Here is the deal:
Bob has BAYC and does not hold any ApeCoin. Alice has Apecoin and does not have any BAYC NFT. Our job is to match Bob and Alice to create a staking pair so that they two can farming with a much higher APR than single staking. Vola
